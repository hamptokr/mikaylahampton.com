          I was born in 1999 in Cincinnati, Ohio. I grew up sandwiched between
          two brothers, Kramer and Parker. My mother, Christine, and father,
          Jody, and all of their siblings grew up in “the ‘Nati” as well. My mom
          and I were outnumbered by the boys, which led them to keep us busy
          with sports and anything else boys liked to do. Video games, tackle
          football, climbing trees and making forts outside were normal everyday
          activities. Aside from power rangers, nerf guns, and backyard
          baseball, I found two things of my own that I loved that the boys
          didn’t share the same passion for: soccer and art. I have played
          soccer since I was three years old. When I wasn’t playing soccer I
          would sit in my room and draw. My passion for kicking the soccer ball
          around led me to step off the well-worn path my family had made in
          Cincinnati and explore a new city. After considernig options near and
          far, I landed in Evanston, IL where I play for Northwestern
          University’s Womens Soccer team. My studies at Northwestern include a
          major in Communication Studies and a Minor within the Segal Design
          program. I stumbled upon my passion for design in my first year at
          Northwestern. Thanks to my professors, Pam Daniels and Kim Hoffman, my
          heart found the creative side of myself that was lost throughout my
          pursuit of playing soccer at the division 1 level. I had discovered
          something that didn’t feel like “work” to me. My parents always
          reiterated the famous quote “do what you love and you’ll never work a
          day in your life”. Suiting up for the wildcats in the fall and
          pursuing my design-related interests year round in one of the greatest
          cities in the world has removed the concept of “work” from my life and
          brought nothing but great people and experiences into my world.
